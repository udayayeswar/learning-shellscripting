Quotes

single Quotes
 ->no special charecters in single quotes, meaning echo '${a}'will print ${a} as output but not the variable data,since $ is a special charecter to pull variable and no special chatercters are allowed in single quotes

Double qoutes
 -> very few charecters are special charecters that include $,meaning  variables are accessible over double qoutes
 -> It is most preferred one
